# currently player movement requires clicking the buttons 2x.

pressing the movement keys requrires 2 clicks, with the first click typing the number, and the second executing the second key press. also, the å and ä keys do not work for climbing on stairs.

with speed 2 player can move in cardinal directions correctly, but diagonally is always one turn (speed rounded down). this implies that the movement progress is not saved between movements, unless perfect 1 is left.
